# Personal Website

The main repository for my personal website.

## Deployment Strategy
I'm putting this straight right now - I'm not a web developer.

I was going to deploy this through docker and nginx, however that's too complicated to get to also run on SSL and not worth the effort.
So I'm just manually using `rsync` to copy this to my `/usr/share/nginx/html` folder on my server.
